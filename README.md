## Key Features

### Data Extraction and Analysis
- **ETL Process:** Performed Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) to store data in a central database.
- **Data Analysis:** Analyzed NIFTY 50 data using Tableau to predict future stock prices, ensuring consistent and accurate training and testing data through data reconciliation.

### Machine Learning Algorithms
- **Algorithm Testing:** Tested ARIMA, LSTM, and Linear Regression algorithms using Jupyter Notebook to determine the best-suited model.
- **Accuracy:** Achieved a 96% accuracy rate using libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.

### Sentiment Analysis
- **Twitter Sentiment Analysis:** Integrated Twitter sentiment analysis into a web app using ReactJS. Collected trending tweets data of stocks using the Twitter API with 85% accuracy utilizing NLTK.

### Backend Development
- **API Deployment:** Leveraged Python to deploy backend APIs, improving data retrieval speed by 30%.
- **Database Storage:** Stored data in Firebase DB, increasing storage efficiency by 25%.

## Project Management
- **Team Leadership:** Led a team of 4 as a Scrum Master, following Agile Scrum practices.
- **Documentation:** Managed proposal and SRS documents, conducted risk assessments, and performed market analysis.
- **Task Coordination:** Coordinated project timelines and tasks using JIRA, resulting in a 20% improvement in project delivery time.
